Hi folks, welcome to CS8! My name is Zechen Ma, and I go by Z/Zee if you find my fist name hard to pronounce. 
I am a 1st year Master student and technically 5th year in the CS BS/MS program. 
My research focus is currently in the area of Augumented Reality. I was recently developing an AR sports coaching application running on the IOS platform. 
I did computer architecture, database, and machine learning projects before so feel free to ask me any questions if you are interested in any of them!
Out of the academic side, I love lifiting weights and playing the piano. Anyway, enjoy the quarter in CS8!
