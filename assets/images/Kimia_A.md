As a Master's student in Computer Science, I would like to welcome everybody to CSW8 and congratulate you on starting your programming with one of the most powerful programming languages. I use Python to work on my area of interest, including but not limited to Machine Learning and its intersections with Computer Vision. I am passionate about driverless vehicles and hope to have the opportunity to get into one of the autonomous driving companies to achieve my goal.

It may be your first time coding with a programming language and you may feel frustrated but don't worry! You can reach me during my office hours to ask your questions and address your concerns.
